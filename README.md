# Shen SBCL

[Shen](http://www.shenlanguage.org) on [Steel Bank Common Lisp](http://www.sbcl.org/) by [Mark Tarver](http://marktarver.com/).

This SBCL port is often considered the de-facto standard implementation of the Shen language. It is also the fastest known port, running the standard test suite in 5-10 seconds, depending on hardware.

Build by running `build.sh`/`build.bat`. This will generate `shen`/`shen.exe`.
